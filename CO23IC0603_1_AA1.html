        <h1>Stars</h1>
        <p>The most well-known celestial objects are stars, which also serve as the basic building blocks of galaxies.</p>

        <p>Deep inside stars, nuclear fusion reactions happen that fuels the stars.
        Nuclear reactions stop when a star's core has fused all of the hydrogen. The core starts to collapse on itself
        and gets much hotter. Since there is still hydrogen available outside the core, hydrogen fusion continues there.
        Slowly, the star starts to cool and expand. At the end, the star becomes a red giant.
